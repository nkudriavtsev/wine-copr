Wine and Pulseaudio Support
---------------------------
Currently wine does not have native support for pulseaudio. However, some
patches exist to make wine use a native pulseaudio backend
(see http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10495). These have been included
into the fedora wine package. If you have problems please do _not_ report them
to the wine project.

Other ways to get wine working with pulseaudio are described below:

ALSA
----
To achieve sound output via the wine alsa driver you need to add
a pulseaudio alsa device to the alsa configuration and activate it in wine. See
http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/PerfectSetup#ALSAApplications on how to do this.
For this alsa-plugins-pulseaudio.i386 should be installed.


Esound
------
If the pulseaudio-esound-compat package is installed selecting the EsounD driver
in wine should enable sound via pulseaudio.

OSS
---
To use the oss driver of wine copy the following script to ~/bin/wine and make
sure that ~/bin is in your path with a higher priority then /usr/bin. The script
will call the pulseaudio dsp wrapper padsp.

#!/bin/sh
if [ -x /usr/lib*/alsa-lib/libasound_module_pcm_pulse.so ] && [ -x "/usr/bin/padsp" ] ; then
    echo "Running padsp as pulseaudio wrapper for wine"
    exec padsp -n Wine -- /usr/bin/wine "$@"
else
    exec /usr/bin/wine "$@"
fi
