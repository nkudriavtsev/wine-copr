Wine and Pulseaudio Support
---------------------------
Currently wine does not have native support for pulseaudio. However, some
patches exist to make wine use a native pulseaudio backend (see [1])
These have been included into the fedora wine package. If you have problems
please do _not_ report them to the wine project.

Here are some useful configuration options taken from [1]:

HKCU\Software\Wine\Drivers:Audio
A string which contains a comma seperated list of audio backends for wine to
try, in order of preference. For example “pulse,alsa,esd”. Settable through
winecfg.

HKCU\Software\Wine\Pulse Driver:MonitorDevices
A string which contains Y or N. If Y, sink monitors will show up as input
devices. If N, only capture sources will be show up as input devices.
Default is Y.

HKCU\Software\Wine\DirectSound:HardwareAcceleration
A string. Also settable in winecfg. When set to “Emulation” WaveOut will be
used for directsound, which is more likely to work, but will have more latency.
When set to “Full” the directsound driver is tried for directsound support,
resulting in less latency, but possibley failure or bad sound.

Other ways to get wine working with pulseaudio are described below:

ALSA
----
To achieve sound output via the wine alsa driver you need to add
a pulseaudio alsa device to the alsa configuration and activate it in wine. See
http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/PerfectSetup#ALSAApplications on how to do this.
For this alsa-plugins-pulseaudio.i386 should be installed.


Esound
------
If the pulseaudio-esound-compat package is installed selecting the EsounD driver
in wine should enable sound via pulseaudio.

OSS
---
To use the oss driver of wine copy the following script to ~/bin/wine and make
sure that ~/bin is in your path with a higher priority then /usr/bin. The script
will call the pulseaudio dsp wrapper padsp.

#!/bin/sh
if [ -x /usr/lib*/alsa-lib/libasound_module_pcm_pulse.so ] && [ -x "/usr/bin/padsp" ] ; then
    echo "Running padsp as pulseaudio wrapper for wine"
    exec padsp -n Wine -- /usr/bin/wine "$@"
else
    exec /usr/bin/wine "$@"
fi
