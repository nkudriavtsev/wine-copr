Wine and Pulseaudio Support
---------------------------

Currently wine does not have native support for pulseaudio. As a workaround to
make wine work alongside pulseaudio select OSS sound output in winecfg. Wine
then calls padsp as a wrapper if alsa-plugin-pulseaudio and pulseaudio-utils is
installed. 

If you think you have found a bug related to this take a look at the bug
reporting procedure at http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/AndreasBierfert/Wine.
